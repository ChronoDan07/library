# Library

## Overview

Library App is a simple web application that allows users to manage a virtual library by adding, viewing, updating, and removing books. The app is built using JavaScript for functionality, and HTML/CSS for structure and styling. This project serves as a practical exercise in object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, and event handling in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add New Book**: Users can add new books to the library by filling out a form. The details include the title, author, number of pages, and read status.
  
- **Display Books**: All books in the library are displayed as cards on the page. Each card shows the book's details and includes options to remove the book or toggle its read status.

- **Remove Book**: Users can remove a book from the library by clicking the remove button on the corresponding book card.

- **Toggle Read Status**: Users can change the read status of a book by clicking a button on the book's card.

- **SVG Book Icons**: Each book is represented with a colorful SVG icon, with random colors assigned to each book for a visually appealing display.
